# üìä DBMS SQL Code Repository

Welcome to my **DBMS SQL Code Repository**!  
This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts, queries, and exercises that I created as part of my Database Management Systems (DBMS) coursework.  
The goal is to serve both as a personal reference and as a learning resource for others studying SQL and DBMS concepts.

## üìå About

This repository was created while exploring and practicing SQL topics in my DBMS subject.  
The scripts here cover a variety of fundamental and intermediate concepts, ranging from creating tables and writing queries to implementing constraints and working with joins.

## üß† Topics Covered

- Creating databases and tables
- Inserting and updating data
- Simple and complex SELECT queries
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.)
- Joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
- Subqueries
- Views
- Constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
- Grouping and sorting data

üìñ Why I Made This
While studying DBMS, I realized writing and saving small, modular scripts helps:

Learn SQL syntax and best practices

Debug and test queries more easily

Reuse scripts in future projects or assignments

Help others who might be learning similar topics
